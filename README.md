The time of day is displayed in a 24-hour format and can be determined by simply adding and multiplying the glowing lights.

The first, uppermost row consists of 4 red lights, whereby each of these lights stands for 5 full hours.
The 4 red lights in the second row display one full hour apiece.
For example, if the first 2 lights in the uppermost row and all 4 lights in the second row are lit up,
that represents 1400 hours, or 2 p.m. (2 Ã— 5 + 4 hours). The third row is composed of 11 lights: 3 red and 8 yellow.
Each light in this row stands for 5 elapsed minutes.
The 3 red lights have been assigned to mark the quarters of an hour and are intended to make reading the clock easier.
Last of all, the yellow row at the very bottom displays units of single minutes.
